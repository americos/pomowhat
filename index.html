				<h1>First things first: What is the Pomodoro Technique®?</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				It's an awesome time management technique to help you manage your work time effectively and get more accomplished. It was created by Francesco Cirillo.

				<h1>Pomowhat? What the heck is a Pomodoro?</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				Every time we say a "Pomodoro" we refer to: "A full 25 minute work session", that means: NO distractions, NO interruptions, NO BS, just get to work!</p> 
			<p>A pomodoro is an atomic entity (more on this later, but in a nutshell... it can't be divided) that helps us to focus on any fiven task at any time. It also the means "Tomato" in Italian. <br/> Mama Mia!

				<h1>Here is what you will need:</h1>

			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>A Timer</li>
					<li>A Todo List</li>
					<li>A pen or pencil</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p class="ps">
				P.S. Timers could be: a physical timer, a Pomodoro software, your watch, your phone or whatever works for you. (Tips on timers later on)

			<header>
				<h1>5 Simple Steps to Start. Bring It!</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Choose a task to complete & Set your Pomodoro timer to 25 mins</li>
					<li>Start your Pomodoro and work for 25 mins straight: GO!</li>
					<li>When the time is over put a check mark on your TO DO List next to the current item you are working on. </li>
					<li>Take a 5 minutes break, enjoy!</li>
					<li>At the end of the break start a new Pomodoro. If this is your fourth pomodoro, take a longer break (20 minutes for example)</li>

		<section class="section-benefits">
			<header>
				<h1>What are the benefits of using this technique?</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>You will get things done.</li>
					<li>You know how long it took you to do XYZ Task. (You just need to count the amount of check marks in your to do list, sweet!)</li>
					<li>Eventually you will be able to better estimate of how long a task will take you (Think of: "This task will take roughly... 6 pomodoros")</li>
					<li>You will be able to focus on work for periods of 25 minutes; then you have 5 minutes to do whatever the hell you want, read your mail, watch a video on you tube, tweet or stalk your ex-girlfriend on facebook if you want to.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p class="ps">Bottomline... There are many benefits and trust me with time you will discover even more.</p>

		<section class="section-howcome">
			<header>
				<h1>Wait, so focus for 25 minutes without getting distracted?</h1>
			</header>
			<p>Anyone can do almost anything for 25 minutes: You can run, walk, talk, eat or read for 25 minutes right?</p> 
			<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson's Law</a>:</p> 
			<h2>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.</h2>
			<p>Just think of the last time your boss ask you do fix that problem in 1 hour... you maybe put on your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli">Niccolo Machiavelli</a> mask and did whatever you had to do to get it done.</p>
			<p class="credits">

			</p>
			<p>Same thing applies here... In 25 minutes you can do a lot a stuff. You just need to focus.</p>

		<section class="section-interrupted">
			<header>
				<h1>What should I do If I get interrupted?</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Put a mark on your TO DO List: A Star * will do, this means that during this task you were interrupted. This voids the Pomodoro.</li>
					<li>Reset your pomodoro, when interrupted the Pomodoro gets invalidated (Remember when we said a Pomodoro is Atomic? Think about this as an all or nothing thing.)</li>
					<li>Next time try to avoid/prevent these interruptions. (check the ninja techniques against interruptions down below)</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

		<section class="section-handleinterruptions">
			<header>
				<h1>We all suffer form interruptions, how can I handle them?</h1>
			</header>
			<p> First let's agree on something... There are 2 types of interruptions:</p>
			<p class="quotes">1) The ones you can control:</p>
			<p>Turn off you email notifiers, stop tweeting and checking facebook. Don't worry your followers and fans will be there at the end of the pomodoro.</p>
			<p class="quotes">2) The ones you can't:</p>
			<p>A phone call, your boss screaming at you, a coworker asking you to check an error on this code, The marketing guy knocking on your cubicle to let you know there are just a few donuts left, etc.</p>
			<p class="ps">Now, you have the power over the ones you can control. Just close, for now, that social network webpage, email notifier, etc.</p>			
			<p>The ones you can't control, that's a little bit more tricky. More on this in the next section</p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="section-interruptionsyoucantcontrol">
			<header>
				<h1>Interruptions you can't control? Try this:</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Let your clients, coworkers, boss, etc. know that you are trying/testing a new productivity technique call "The Pomodoro Technique" so you won't be available to answer that email, chat message, etc, immediately. </li>
					<li>Resist the temptation to answer emails right away. <b>DON'T WORRY</b>: if its an urgency they will call you.</li>
					<li>If somebody is pinging you every minute, tell him politely that you need to get "in the zone" so your are sorry but can talk right now.</li>
					<li>Put on your headphones and play that awesome song that you love hearing while working.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="ps">Bottomline If your office is on fire or the SWAT Team is entering your CEO's office next door... OK then stop what you are doing, place a note of what you were currently doing to cancel that pomodoro. Then keep calm, breath and run to your nearest exit!</p>

				<h1>Should I use The Pomodoro Technique for every task in my day?</h1>
			</header>
			<h2>NO</h2>
			<p>Don't use it for activities where you are having fun and you don't have a deadline. For instance don't use it for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Spending time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, kids, family, similar other, etc.</li>
				<li>Reading, cooking, walking your dog and other leisure activities.</li>
				<li>Practicing sports, going to the gym, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="ps">You get the idea... I suggest you use it when you have to get something done and/or you have a deadline.</p>
